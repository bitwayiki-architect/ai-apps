## What Is Vibe Coding?

**Vibe Coding** is a philosophy of coding that emphasizes:
- **Flow and creativity** — letting ideas evolve naturally while staying in tune with user needs.  
- **AI-first design** — integrating artificial intelligence from the start rather than as an afterthought.  
- **Iterative feedback loops** — rapid prototyping, testing, and refinement based on real-world use.  
- **Human-centered purpose** — ensuring each AI solution serves an ethical and valuable role in society.
